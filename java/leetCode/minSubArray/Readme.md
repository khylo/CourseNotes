Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a 
subarray
 whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
