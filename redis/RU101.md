Overview.
Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can't be larger than memory
Testing your use case is trivial. Use the redis-benchmark utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the INFO memory command.

## Redis Data Structures
### Keys
Amy binary structure can be a key, up to 512 MB
Lenght vs readability

### Logical Databases 
logical database is identified by a zero-based index. The default is database 0.  Within a logical database, the key names are unique as mentioned. 
But the same key name can appear in multiple logical databases,

In practical terms, they are best  suited when you need separate key spaces for a single application rather than separating

REdis cluster only supports Database 0

Normally just using database 0

Often colo : used to seperate parts of names..

Case sensitive.. 

e.g. user:1000:followers

set customer:10000 fred   [EX seconds] [PC mills] [NX| XX] ## Can be atomic, and check if key does not exist (NX) or already exists XX (update)
get customer:10000

keys    # ALways blkc until complete. Never use in Prod.. Useful fo debuggin at non-Prod
scan # Iterates using cursor.. Blcoks but only for iteration

keys custome:1*

scan 0 MATCH customer:1*    # May need to run multiple times using start point returned each time

unlink customer:1000   # REturns number of keys removed
exists customer:10000


Finished on week 1 Keys.. Strings next
