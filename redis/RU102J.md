# Week 2 
## Lua scripting
This is a scripting language for Resis that allwos atomic actions. It can be called directly from jedis

var sha = jedis.scriptLoad()  // loads th4 script
jedis.evalsha(sha, key, args) // pass in sha plus list of keys and args

## Pipelining
Pipelining sends multiple commands to the Redis server in one network round trip. This improves performance by minimizing network latency and reducing the need for expensive syscalls.

Calling sync() tells Jedis to send all commands in the pipeline to the Redis server. Each command is then executed in order, and all of the results are returned at once after the last command has finished.

NOte these are not atomic.. so transactionality might not be possible, If you want that use transactions or Lua sctipting

Setup with jedis.pipeline().. Trigger with p.sync().

## Transaction
Similar to pipelining but doesn't allow other clients to run in parallel

Setup with jedis.multi()... Run with t.exec()
Redis guarantees that both transactions and Lua scripts are executed atomically on the server. This means that no other client's commands will run at this time. When using a pipeline, commands in the pipeline will be executed in order, but commands from other clients may be run between them. Commands sent to the server from different connections will be executed in the order that they are received.
