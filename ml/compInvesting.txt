Portfolio managers... 
	Mutual Fund and ETF's
		Expense ration 1% of funds under mgmt.. so motivation is to have more assets under mgmt
	Hedge Fund - 2 and 20.. motivation is to make profits (even if large fund)
		2% of assets under mgmt and 20% of profits.. so if fund is 1mill and returns 20% .. then compensation is 20k (2%) + 40k (20% => 1M*.2*.2)
	
	Who invests
		Individuals
		Institutions (pension instites)
		Funds of funds
	
	How to attrack investors
		good track record
		back tests
		pigeon hole (for institutional investors)
		
		reference to a benchmark
		absolute return
		
	Metrics
		(Annual) Return
			value[end]/ value[start] -1			
			
		Risk: Std deviation of return (Volatility)
			std_metric = stddev(dailyReturn)
			
		Risk: Draw down   (drop in value of fund)
			Max Drawdown is 100% at local max height.. what is percent drop to local Min
		
		Reward/Risk: Sharpe Ratio  (measure of reward over risk)
			most 'important measure of asset performance.. How well does asset perform for the Risk that was taken
			Higher sharpe ration is better (lower risk)
			S = E[R-Rf]/ Std      (Note STD = sigma .. sigma is symbol for Std.. Variance = sigma^2)        Rf = libor or low risk asset
			 = K dailyRet/ Std(DR)  (simplified version ...no Rf)
				K = sqrt(250) .... number of days in a trading year (N.B. if calulcting monthly or somthing differnt then use differnt K eg sqrt(12))
		
		Reward/Risk: Sortino Ratio  (higher if more downward motion ). Doesn't count upward volatility

	Trailing stop  order
		-> limit order (since these are suported by exchange)
		We are selling
		Once order tirggers.. Order goes to Market maker (exteranl company ,e.g. citigroup, citadel)
			- Market maker. 
				Can goto exchange and get market price (buy/ sell spread)
				or external liquididy providers (Dark pool)
					these can provide improved price (10th of penny for example)
					if price not there they can make market in their own dark pool
				
				Most orders will goto market maker (and their dark pool)
				
				Market maker may accept all or part of trade.. 
				
				Any part of trade traded. then goes to exchange (printed)
				
				DTTMC.. Clearing company for stocks.. they get a copy of 'print'
				
			- Goes to exchange
			
			Opening days.. Orders are priced at mid point of buys and sells on exchanges.. goal to limit movement after opening point
				Nasdaq does this automatically
			
		Things that can go wrong e.g. Facebook ipo
			Similar process as opening day		
			Huge demand on facebook to buy and sell on openeing which overwhelmed services

Estiming company value
	3 sample ways to measure it are 
		Market cap.. # shares by share value
		Future dividends (returns) / Intrinsic value
			Future returns (= div/(1- gamma)   where gamma is discount value (e.g. 0.95)
		Book Value ...... Value of all assets added up minus liabilities
	
	Future dividends
	e.g. company makes $1 per year
		so what is value of $1 in the future
			what would we pay now for $1 in a year.... 		say .95 - discount rate
			
			Value = Sum(.95^#year) => .95 +  .95^2 + .95^3 + .... 
				= dividend/(1-gamma)  
					=  1/(1-.95) => $20
					
	How do events effect price
		MacKinley... Event studies in Economics and Finance.
			e.g. bad news.. price on average is dropping before event. .Drops most when news comes out.. Often then recovers slightly 
				likewise with good news

	How  does market process information... Efficient Market hypothesis
			
	
Capital Assets Pricing Model (CapM  from 1966) led to efficient market hypothesis
	used in valuations.. takes into account rising tide... e.g. S&P portfolio 
		Led to Index investing
		
	Return on market has 2 components
		1- Systematic (market) (times a multiplier Beta)
		2- Residual
	Expected value of residual = 0
	Market return
		Risk free rate of return + excess return
	
	Ri = Beta *Rm + Alpha...    
		R is return (ie. daily/ annual return).. Ri is stocks return ... Rm is market return
		Alpha = residual  or information exploit (how it differs from market).. in CapM they expect it to goto 0
		Beta
		
		if we Graph Ri vs Rm  (end up with elipse lots of times)  (Rm horizontal.. Ri Vertical)
		 |   .
		0| :::			most are gather around 0, but may be slight bias for alpha.. slope of line is Beta
		 |'_______
		use linear regresion fit line to scatter plot... Slope is Beta.. Alpha is where line hits Vertical Ri axis)
		
		corelation coefficient is how close scatter plot matches line  >-1 and <1.0.... 
			1.0 = perfect correlation
			-1 = inverse correlation (ie. amrket goes up.. stock goes down)
		
		Beta and correlation are different. Can have same Beta (slope) but different correlation coefficient
		
	CApM predicts Alpha is 0.. but Active Portfolio Mgmt says it is not and we can estimate Alpha
	
	Expected excess returns are proportional to beta... 
		Beta greater than 1 implies stock returns higher than market (multiple) .. Therefore can make morey in theory
		Greater Beta greater risk.. (different to correlation coeff)
	Beta of a porfolio = weighted sum of betas of components
		Rp = Sum (Wi * Ri)..  Rp = return of Portfolio... Sum of Weight of stock i by Return of Stock i
		Betap = Sum(Wi * Betai)
		
		Weight calculated by value of component in portfolio e.g.g $1000 IBM $1000 Aol and $2000 goog.. 
			Wibm = 0.25 Wgoog = .5
			Note weight is calculated on total holding value.. not just number of shares etc
		
		
	So if we think IBM will go up.. We go Long with IBM
		But say market drops.. It will bring IBM with it and IBM will go down (but by less than market.. Alpha rate)
		
		So we actualyl Long IBM  AND short SPY
		
		so we buy and sell same amount so Wibm = 0,5 Wspy = -0.5
		
		Ribm = .5Beta + alpha
		Rspy = -.5Beta +alpha (spy) ... But alpha of Spy =0
			assume same Beta
		R = alpha(Ibm)
		
		
		
Week 4	
	Looking for arbitrage oppertunites. e.g. price greater than or less than true value
	
	Technical analysis.. Pricing and volumne only
	
	Fundamental Analysis
		Finalcial statements
		P/E rations, cash on hand dividends
		
	Source of data   news sites.. SEc fillings
	
	3 Versions of Efficient Market Hypothesis EMH (see wikipedia efficient markets hypothesis
		Weak
			Current prices reflect all past publicly available information
			Prohibits profits from Technical Analysys
		Semi-Strong
			Weak + PRices change instanly to reflect new information
			Prohibits profit from TA and Fundamental Analysis
		Strong
			Semi-String + prices instantly reflect even hidden or insider information
			Prohibits profit from insider information
			
		Is EMH true ?
			Relationship found between P/E and 
			
			Fundametal information can be correlated to future returns
			
		Behavioural Economics argues against EMH
			Cognitive bias such as 
				Overconfidence
				Over-reaction
				Inforation bias
				
	Event Studies
		AC McKinlay event study in economics and finance
		
		docuemntsed news events  (e.g. jump in daily price)
		
		shows stock on average drifting upwards before news item. Then jump up after event
			Likewise for bad news.. price is drifting down before event
			Also flat line for random event
			
			For down movements tend to have over-raction effect, where after 2 days of negitive changes after event it tends to bounce back
				Not really true for good news.. Levels off
		
Week 5		
	Portfolio Optimization
		Given a set of equities and a target return.. What is the optimum breakdown of equities in the portfolio
		Inputs
			Expected return for each equity
			Volatility (risk) for each equity
			Target Return of portfolio
			Covariance Matrix
		Ouput
			Portfolio weights
			Minimize risk for taget return
	
		Correlation - Covariance
					
		Mean Variance Optimization
			Markowitz. won nobel prize in 1990
		
		Efficient Frontier
		Curve.. Highest risk = 100% in equity with highest return
				Lowest risk = lowest volatility.. but may not be positive return
				Efficient frontier is often chosen as middle point = max sharpe ratio
	
		See tutorial 8
	Digging into data
		Looking up event studies to chose strategy
		
		Suvivor bias
			Looking at historical data.. some companies die.. So taking newer S&P 500 from 2012.. will have better results than that of 2008 if computing event studies for 2008
				since none of the 2012 companies will have faile, but some of 2008 will have
		
			One approach to mimnimize.. Create several random portfolios, and use them as benchmarks.
				Can you devise strategy that does better than this.. may be viable strategy
	
	Adjusted vs actual close price
		Actual is close at business end
		
		Adjusted is adjusted for things like stock splits, dividents etc. 
			Look at example from notes.. 1962.. actual close 572... adjusted close 2.53
	
	
		Data is QSTK is adjusted for splits not dividends
			However you can download xls files from yahoo that includes divdends as well (apparently)
			
			Fill forward first  (don't want inflated value before it was available)
			THen fill back (for equitries that have a NaN at start)
			
	Data sanity and scrubbing
		Good Data is importatnt. Otherwise might find false strategies
		
	Bad Data
		e.g. symbol DD 1987 - 1989 (on google finance.) factor of 10 problem for a year (1988)
		
		reverse splits been missed ae relatively common
		Order of magnitude drop followed by order of magnitude climb
		Database updates missing chunks of symbols (e.g. a - l symbols missing)
		
		Need to build in checks or alerts for this
		
	Sanity checks
		Scan new data for ~50% drops or 200% gains (probably a split). Very rare for real data
		NaNs in DOW stocks / S&P(probably bad data feed)
		Recent adjusted prices less than 0.01 ... might be factor of 10 error
		NaN's > 20 trading days
		
	Scrubbing
		Remove or repair. Can only repair if you have multiple sources
		
	Homework 3
		event study -> orders -> Market simulator -> Report
		
Week 6
	Event study.. How to operationalize events into orders
	
	Firstly sanity check result.. Does event match what we are looking for
	
	The fundamental law and coin flipping
		Thought experiment flip coin
			uncertainty = Beta... Coin bias = alpha.. say 51% heads
			We bet one token
				win = 2 tokens
				lose = 0 tokens
			what if we bet in parallel	
				What is expected return
				case 1
					one bet with $1000
					0.51*1000 +.49*(-1000) = $20
				case 2
					1000 bets with $1
					1000*(0.51*1 +.49*(-1)) = $20
					
			Risk Measure 1.. Possibilty we lose everything
				Single Bet => 49%... (High)
				Multi Bet => 0.49^1000 = very small
				
			Risk Measure Volatility
				Single bet
					=stdev(1000,0,0,0,0,0) = 31.62   (1 bet of 1000, plus 999 bets of 0)
				Multi Bet
					=stdev(1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1 ...) = 1.00 
			Sharpe  SR = sharpe Ratio
				SR single = .02/1 * sqrt (1000)
				SR(multi) = SR(single) * sqrt(1000) (in coin flipping case)
	
		In general			
			SR(multi) = C * alpha * sqrt(bets)
		Information Ratio.. ratio of reward over risk
		Information Co-efficient.. skill ... what do we know e.g. 51% heads
		Strategy Breadth (num of bets)
	
	Fundamental Law (of active portfolio mgmt) .. Grinhold and Kahn chapters 5&6.... also augmentedtrader.wordpress.com
		e.g. Jim Simons (rentec .. renaissance tech) and WArren Buffet BRK
		
		CAPM  .. read from Active Portfolio Management book
			Rp(t) = Beta .Rm(t) + alphap  (t)
			
		Information Ratio = IR = mean (alphap(t))/ stdev(alphap(t))   = similar to sharpe
		
		Information Coefficient (IC)  .. what do we know 
			correlation of forecase to actual return (e.g. biased coin 2%)
		Breath BR = num bets
	
	IR = IC sqrt(BR)	=                      mean (alphap(t))/ stdev(alphap(t))
	
	Capm   (generaize it for a portfolio)
		Rp(t) = Beta .Rm(t) + alphap  (t)    
			alphap can be split into 2 components.. alpha (skill), and epsilon (random.. unmodelled information that effects price)
			
			rp = Sum(hi*ri)   where hi is % holding of stock i.. Sum over all stocks in i
			
		Can use this to cancel out market component if we know betas and alphas of the stocks in our portfolio
		
			e.g. R1 = 2.rm +0.2   (Beta = 2.. alpha = 0.2)
				 R2 = 1.rm +0.1   (Beta = 1.. alpha = 0.1)
				 
				 so h1 = 1/3.... h2 = 2/3
				 
				 so Rp =

	Technical Analysis  (Technical analyis explained by Martin Pring)
		Studies show simple indicators were profitable in past, but now multiple patterns may work
		
		Potential value in contra indicators.. e.g. stock going up and market going down, or vice versa
		
		Identify a trend reversal at an early stage, and rige on that trend until weigth of evidense shows trend has reversed
			Assumption.. People will make same mistakes they have made in the past
			
		Three branches
			Sentiment Indicators
				Emotions of investors
			Flow of Funds
				How much money in or out
				What capacity is in market for buy and sell
			Market Structure Indicators
				price and volumne.. Most indicators fall here
				
		Tuckers option
			Best over short term (more inclined to high trading strategies)
			Long term indicators don't tend to work (e.g. if holding for long time..)
			
		Mean reversion
			Prices tend to revert to mean over time
			e.g. SMA (Simple Moving Average).. e.g.g if price crosses SMA line
			MACD (Moving average Convergence, divergence) (Fast average, and slow average.. e.g. 12 days and 26 days) EMA (Exponential moving average)
				when lines cross. If fast ma crosses up thru slow ma.. Buy signal  if it crosses moving down then sell
				
		Bollinger Bands -> upper and lower bands contract and expand.. Volatility makes it expand.. calm period means they contract
			middle line = moving average
			If stock crosses top band then sell indicator.. Viceversa for bottem band
			upper band.. STD of price above MA
			Lower band.. STD of price below MA
				(hence volatility expands band)
				Also since volatility expands band it helps to stop excessive buying and selling
			
		Demo with Google Finance
			SMA
			
		Important to convert all to std units for computation
			e.g. for bollanger +1 for crossing bottemn band (buy) -1 for crossing top band (sell)
