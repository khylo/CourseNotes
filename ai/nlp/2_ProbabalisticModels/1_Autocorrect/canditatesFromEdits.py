You now have a list of candidate strings created after performing a delete edit.
Next step will be to filter this list for candidate words found in a vocabulary.
Given the example vocab below, can you think of a way to create a list of 
candidate words ?
Remember, you already have a list of candidate strings, some of which are
 certainly not actual words you might find in your vocabulary !

So from the above list earz, darz, derz, deaz, dear.
You're really only interested in dear.
