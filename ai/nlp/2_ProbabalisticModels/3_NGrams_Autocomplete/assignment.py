Exercise 2 - tokenize_sentences
The next step is to tokenize sentences (split a sentence into a list of words).

Convert all tokens into lower case so that words which are capitalized (for example, at the start of a sentence) in the original text are treated the same as the lowercase versions of the words.
Append each tokenized list of words into a list of tokenized sentences.
Please use nltk.word_tokenize to split sentences into tokens.
If you used str.split instead of nltk.word_tokenize, there are additional edge cases to handle, such as the punctuation (comma, period) that follows a word.

Exercise 4 - count_words
You won't use all the tokens (words) appearing in the data for training. Instead, you will use the more frequently used words.

You will focus on the words that appear at least N times in the data.
First count how many times each word appears in the data.
You will need a double for-loop, one for sentences and the other for tokens within a sentence.

Handling 'Out of Vocabulary' words
If your model is performing autocomplete, but encounters a word that it never saw during training, it won't have an input word to help it determine the next word to suggest. The model will not be able to predict the next word because there are no counts for the current word.

This 'new' word is called an 'unknown word', or out of vocabulary (OOV) words.
The percentage of unknown words in the test set is called the OOV rate.
To handle unknown words during prediction, use a special token to represent all unknown words 'unk'.

Modify the training data so that it has some 'unknown' words to train on.
Words to convert into "unknown" words are those that do not occur very frequently in the training set.
Create a list of the most frequent words in the training set, called the closed vocabulary .
Convert all the other words that are not part of the closed vocabulary to the token 'unk'.
