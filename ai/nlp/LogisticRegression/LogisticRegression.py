# Combines positive and negative tweets into one list
# Creates corresponding labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
# Train/Test Split :
# Loads pre-processed features from a CSV file
# Extracts three features: bias, positive word count, and negative word count
# Gets the corresponding sentiment labels
# Note that process_tweet() and build_freqs() are supplied tasks in coursera env so not available
# process_tweet: cleans the text, tokenizes it into separate words, removes stopwords, and converts words to stems.
# build_freqs: this counts how often a word in the 'corpus' (the entire set of tweets) was associated with a 
#       positive label '1' or a negative label '0', then builds the 'freqs' dictionary, where each key is the (word,label) tuple, and the value is the count of its frequency within the corpus of tweets.

# This is an example of a positive tweet:  
#FollowFriday @France_Inte @PKuchly57 @Milipol_Paris for being top engaged members in my community this week :)

#This is an example of the processed version of the tweet: 
# ['followfriday', 'top', 'engag', 'member', 'commun', 'week', ':)']

data = pd.read_csv('./data/logistic_features.csv'); # Load a 3 columns csv file using pandas function

# Convert data (Name:value) into just values
# Each feature is labeled as bias, positive and negative
X = data[['bias', 'positive', 'negative']].values # Get only the numerical values of the dataframe
Y = data['sentiment'].values; # Put in Y the corresponding labels or sentiments

print(X.shape) # Print the shape of the X part
print(X) # Print some rows of X

#Load a pretrained Logistic Regression model
#In the same way, as part of this week's assignment, a Logistic regression model must be trained. 
#The next cell contains the resulting model from such training. Notice that a list of 3 numeric values represents the whole model, that we have called theta  ùúÉ
theta = [6.03518871e-08, 5.38184972e-04, -5.58300168e-04]
